 <br>Waking up in somewhat of a panic, The Flame of Faerun scrambled to their feet and readied their weapons as the Dire Troll and the Wyvern bared down on them and a fight ensued. It was somewhat fortuitous that the Dire Troll and Wyvern had weakened each other. After the fight, Finn, the alchemist's apprentice, harvested the blood of the Dire Troll and Wyvern venom to be used for some potions and other alchemical creations later on.<br>On the road to Daggerford, where Finn was heading, and on the way to Waterdeep and eventually Neverwinter, the party stumbled across a group of lizardmen off the side of the road that seemed to be searching for something. Naively, they approached and the lizardmen attacked. They were dispatched of somewhat easily and the party looked for what the lizardmen were looking for. Eventually. <a class="internal-link" data-href="Flame Of Faerun/Leucius Alistar Stonewall.md" href="https://flame-of-faerun.com/flame-of-faerun/leucius-alistar-stonewall.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Leucius</a> found a red dragon egg buried under some mud. After much deliberation, the party took it with them and headed out.<br>Upon reaching Daggerford, more of a military outpost than a proper town. The party delivered Finn safely to his alchemist master who rewarded the party with some healing potions and a few vials of wyvern venom poison. The wyvern venom was now diluted enough that it wouldn't hurt you if it got on your skin, only if it got into your bloodstream.<br>That night, while resting, <a class="internal-link" data-href="Flame Of Faerun/Ingrid Evergleam.md" href="https://flame-of-faerun.com/flame-of-faerun/ingrid-evergleam.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ingrid</a> had a vivid dream where they were turned into a mind flayer by their mother and woke up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat. Looking out their window, Ingrid saw a small child out in the middle of town...looking directly at their window. Upon going outside out of concern for the child. The child ran at Ingrid and turned into what to them, looked like Vecna before diving through them and disappearing. The rest of the party whom Ingrid had awoken did not see this. Ingrid passed out either out of fear, being passed through by a ghost or something. The rest of the party went back inside dragging Ingrid along with them, and Leucius made sure that they made it through the night safely.]]></description><link>https://flame-of-faerun.com/session-notes/12.-december-17th,-2024-on-the-road-again.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Session Notes/12.

 <br>The Flame of Faerun gathered their bearings and continued on their journey towards Neverwinter. They had a few stops in between, most notably at Waterdeep.<br>It took them a few days but they got half way between Daggerford and Waterdeep before they saw a strange, floating pillar above Ardeep Woods to the east. After some deliberation, the group decided to check it out. Once they got close, the tower disappeared and they were ambushed by three Assassin Vines and five Stirges. While the group quickly dispatched of the Stirges, one of the Assassin Vines got a hold of <a class="internal-link" data-href="Flame Of Faerun/Ingrid Evergleam.md" href="https://flame-of-faerun.com/flame-of-faerun/ingrid-evergleam.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ingrid</a> and started to make a run for it. While it almost got away, it was eventually taken down, but not before it had taken Ingrid with it. Ruga tried to see if anything could be done, but unfortunately Ingrid had lost their life in the ambush. <br>As they traveled a few more days and got to Waterdeep, they were unable to find a temple that was willing to revive Ingrid, until they found the Temple of Sune, where <a class="internal-link" data-href="Flame Of Faerun/Kavyl Silkweaver the Highborn.md" href="https://flame-of-faerun.com/flame-of-faerun/kavyl-silkweaver-the-highborn.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kavyl</a> convinced them to at least give it a shot before refusing. They provided the diamond needed to cast the Raise Dead spell and after an attempt to give Ingrid new life, they had unfortunately failed and Ingrid's injuries and time that had passed was too much for the spell to succeed.<br>Defeated, the remaining members of the Flame of Faerun left the temple and went to plan their next move.]]></description><link>https://flame-of-faerun.com/session-notes/13.-january-14th,-2025-ardeep-woods.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Session Notes/13.
